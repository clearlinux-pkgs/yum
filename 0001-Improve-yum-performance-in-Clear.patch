Subject: [PATCH] Improve yum performance in Clear

Clear Linux uses yum to do dependency management with the repository's
rpm files. Through that lens, yum database corruption is not import as
the database files are impermanent anyway and speed is the major
priority. To make this trade off turn off the synchronous pragma when
opening a sqlite db.
